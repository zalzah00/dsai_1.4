## Brief

### Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces the SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements. Learners will be able to query and manipulate data in a database
using operators, functions, filters, sorting, aggregate functions, group by and advanced operators/functions.

---

## Part 1 - Connecting to database

Open DBeaver and create a new connection to the DuckDB database file `db/unit-1-4.db`.

The table we will be using is `main.resale_flat_prices_2017`. It contains HDB's resale flat prices based on registration date from Jan-2017 onwards.

The description for each column (a.k.a data dictionary) is as follows:

| Title               | Column Name         | Data Type                  | Unit of Measure | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Month               | month               | Datetime (Month) "YYYY-MM" | -               | -           |
| Town                | town                | Text (General)             | -               | -           |
| Flat type           | flat_type           | Text (General)             | -               | -           |
| Block               | block               | Text (General)             | -               | -           |
| Street name         | street_name         | Text (General)             | -               | -           |
| Storey range        | storey_range        | Text (General)             | -               | -           |
| Floor area sqm      | floor_area_sqm      | Numeric (General)          | sqm             | -           |
| Flat model          | flat_model          | Text (General)             | -               | -           |
| Lease commence date | lease_commence_date | Datetime (Year) "YYYY"     | -               | -           |
| Remaining lease     | remaining_lease     | Text (General)             | -               | -           |
| Resale price        | resale_price        | Numeric (General)          | $               | -           |

## Part 2 - Querying data

### Basic syntax

`SELECT` is the most commonly used DML statement. It is used to query data from a database.

Select a column from a table:

```sql
SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;
```

Select multiple columns from a table:

```sql
SELECT <column_name_1>, <column_name_2> FROM <table_name>;
```

Example:

```sql
SELECT street_name FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

_No need to specify the schema `main` as it is the default schema_.

Replace `<column_name>` with `*` to select all columns from a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

> Select any 3 columns from the table.

### Operators and functions

Operators and functions are used to perform operations on data. They are used in the `SELECT` statement. The result of the operation is returned as a new column.

#### Operators

Operators are used to perform mathematical operations on data. The following are some commonly used operators:

| Operator | Description    |
| -------- | -------------- |
| `+`      | Addition       |
| `-`      | Subtraction    |
| `*`      | Multiplication |
| `/`      | Division       |
| `%`      | Modulo         |

If we want to get the resale price in thousands, we can use the `/` operator to divide the resale price by 1000:

```sql
SELECT resale_price / 1000 FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

Use the `AS` keyword to rename the column:

```sql
SELECT resale_price / 1000 AS resale_price_thousands FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

There are also non-mathematical operators which we will explore later.

#### Functions

Functions are used to perform operations on data. The following are some example functions:

| Function   | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ABS()`    | Returns the absolute value of a number.                                  |
| `ROUND()`  | Returns a numeric value rounded to a specified number of decimal places. |
| `LOWER()`  | Returns a string in lowercase.                                           |
| `UPPER()`  | Returns a string in uppercase.                                           |
| `LENGTH()` | Returns the length (number of characters) of a string.                   |
| `TRIM()`   | Removes leading and trailing spaces from a string.                       |
| `CONCAT()` | Concatenates two or more strings.                                        |

Example:

```sql
SELECT ABS(resale_price) FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

> Select column town as lowercase
>
> Concatenate block and street_name and return as a new column named address

### Filters

Filters are used to filter data based on a condition. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter data in a `SELECT` statement. It commonly uses comparison operators to compare values.

The following are some commonly used operators:

| Operator | Description      |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| `=`      | Equal            |
| `<>`     | Not equal        |
| `>`      | Greater          |
| `>=`     | Greater or equal |
| `<`      | Less             |
| `<=`     | Less or equal    |
| `AND`    | Logical AND      |
| `OR`     | Logical OR       |
| `NOT`    | Logical NOT      |

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM resale_flat_prices_2017 WHERE town = 'BUKIT MERAH';
```

We can introduce line breaks (new lines) to make the query more readable:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017
WHERE town = 'BUKIT MERAH';
```

> Select flats with floor area greater than 100 sqm
>
> Select flats with resale price between 400,000 and 500,000
>
> Select flats with lease commence date later than year 2000 and floor area greater than 100 sqm

### Sorting

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort data by a column in a `SELECT` statement. It can sort data in ascending or descending order. The default is ascending order. It can also sort by multiple columns.

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM resale_flat_prices_2017 ORDER BY lease_commence_date;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM resale_flat_prices_2017 ORDER BY resale_price DESC;
```

Return flats with the most recent lease commence date and highest to lowest resale price:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017
ORDER BY lease_commence_date DESC, resale_price DESC;
```

> Select flats from highest to lowest resale price in Punggol

### Aggregate functions

Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. The following are some commonly used aggregate functions:

| Function  | Description                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `COUNT()` | Returns the number of rows in a table. |
| `SUM()`   | Returns the sum of values in a column. |
| `AVG()`   | Returns the average value of a column. |
| `MIN()`   | Returns the minimum value in a column. |
| `MAX()`   | Returns the maximum value in a column. |
| `FIRST()` | Returns the first value in a column.   |
| `LAST()`  | Returns the last value in a column.    |

Example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

```sql
SELECT AVG(resale_price) FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

```sql
SELECT MAX(resale_price) FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

> Select the average resale price of flats in Bishan
>
> Select the total resale value (price) of flats in Tampines

### Group by

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group. The `GROUP BY` clause comes after the `WHERE` clause and before the `ORDER BY` clause.

Average resale price of flats in each town:

```sql
SELECT town, AVG(resale_price)
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017
GROUP BY town;
```

You can also group by multiple columns:

```sql
SELECT town, lease_commence_date, AVG(resale_price)
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017
GROUP BY town, lease_commence_date;
```

You can replace the `town, lease_commence_date` after the `GROUP BY` with `1, 2` to group by the first and second columns:

```sql
SELECT town, lease_commence_date, AVG(resale_price)
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

Combined with sorting:

```sql
SELECT town, lease_commence_date, AVG(resale_price)
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017
GROUP BY town, lease_commence_date
ORDER BY town, lease_commence_date DESC;
```

> Select the average resale price by flat type
>
> Select the average resale price by flat type and flat model
>
> Select the average resale price by town and lease commence date only for lease commence dates after year 2010 and sort by town (descending) and lease commence date (descending)

### Having

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups in a `GROUP BY` clause. It is similar to the `WHERE` clause but it is used with aggregate functions. The `HAVING` clause comes after the `GROUP BY` clause and before the `ORDER BY` clause.

Average resale price of flats in each town with average resale price greater than 500,000:

```sql
SELECT town, AVG(resale_price)
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017
GROUP BY town
HAVING AVG(resale_price) > 500000;
```

Difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`:

```sql
SELECT town, AVG(resale_price)
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017
WHERE resale_price > 500000
GROUP BY town;
```

```sql
SELECT town, AVG(resale_price)
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017
GROUP BY town
HAVING AVG(resale_price) > 500000;
```

`HAVING` can only be used on columns that appear in the `SELECT` clause or columns that are used in aggregate functions.

> Select the maximum resale price by town only for town with maximum resale price greater than 1,000,000

### Advanced operators and functions

#### `IN`

The `IN` operator is used to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause. It is similar to using multiple `OR` operators.

```sql
SELECT * FROM resale_flat_prices_2017 WHERE town IN ('BUKIT MERAH', 'BUKIT TIMAH');
```

#### `BETWEEN`

The `BETWEEN` operator is used to specify a range of values in a `WHERE` clause. It is similar to using `>=` and `<=` operators.

```sql
SELECT * FROM resale_flat_prices_2017 WHERE resale_price BETWEEN 400000 AND 500000;
```

#### `LIKE`

The `LIKE` operator is used to specify a pattern in a `WHERE` clause. It is used with the `%` wildcard to match zero or more characters and the `_` wildcard to match a single character.

```sql
SELECT * FROM resale_flat_prices_2017 WHERE town LIKE 'B%';
```

#### `DISTINCT`

The `DISTINCT` operator is used to return unique (remove duplicated) values in a `SELECT` statement.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT town FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

> Return the unique flat types and flat models

#### `CASE`

The `CASE` expression is used to evaluate a list of conditions and return a value. It is similar to the `IF` statement in programming languages. It starts with the `CASE` keyword followed by the `WHEN` keyword and ends with the `END` keyword.

```sql
SELECT town, resale_price,
CASE WHEN resale_price > 500000 THEN 'High' ELSE 'Low' END AS price_level
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

You can also use multiple `WHEN` clauses:

```sql
SELECT town, resale_price,
CASE WHEN resale_price > 1000000 THEN 'High' WHEN resale_price > 500000 THEN 'Medium' ELSE 'Low' END AS price_level
FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

> Return the records with a new column `flat_size` with values `Small` if flat type is `1-3 ROOM`, `Medium` if flat type is `4 ROOM` and `Large` if flat type is `5 ROOM`, `EXECUTIVE` or `MULTI-GENERATION`

#### `CAST`

The `CAST` function is used to convert a value from one data type to another data type.

```sql
SELECT town, resale_price, CAST(resale_price AS INTEGER) FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

or `::` can be used instead of `CAST`:

```sql
SELECT town, resale_price, resale_price::INTEGER FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

#### Date functions

We can convert the `month` column from varchar to `date` using `CAST`. We can concatenate the day of the month to the month.

```sql
SELECT *, CONCAT(month, '-01')::date AS transaction_date FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```

We can use our knowledge of DDL to add that as a new column to the table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE resale_flat_prices_2017 ADD COLUMN transaction_date date;
```

```sql
UPDATE resale_flat_prices_2017 SET transaction_date = CONCAT(month, '-01')::date;
```

We can extract the year of transaction from the transaction date:

```sql
SELECT *, date_part('year',transaction_date) AS transaction_year FROM resale_flat_prices_2017;
```
